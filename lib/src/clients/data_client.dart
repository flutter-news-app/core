///
/// This interface is designed to handle operations for *both* user-scoped
/// resources (where data is specific to a user) and global resources
/// (where data is not tied to a specific user, e.g., admin-managed content).
/// The optional "userId" parameter in methods is used to differentiate
/// between these two use cases.

/// While primarily focused on standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
/// operations, this interface can be extended to include other data access
/// methods.
///
/// Implementations of this interface are expected to handle the underlying
/// communication (e.g., HTTP requests) and manage serialization/deserialization
/// via provided [FromJson] and [ToJson] functions if necessary.
/// Implementations must check the "userId" parameter: if provided, scope
/// the operation to that user; if `null`, perform the operation on global
/// resources (where applicable for the specific method).
